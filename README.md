## 📂 Portfolio Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Smart Arduino Home Security System with Password-Enabled Alarm and Multi-Sensor Control](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Arduino-project-on-Home-Security) | An Arduino-based home security system that integrates multiple sensors (DHT11, PIR, flame, reed switch, photoresistor) with a password-enabled alarm. Features real-time LCD display, sensor-triggered alerts, and custom password logic for secure arming/disarming. |
| [mmWave-5G-Channel-MATLAB-Simulation](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/mmWave-5G-Channel-MATLAB-Simulation) | MATLAB implementations for simulating 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) wireless channels. The simulations include Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation, transmit beamforming, and general modeling of mobile equipment behavior in a 5G mmWave environment. |
| [MATLAB FFT Analysis of Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (PMUTs)](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Frequency-Analysis-of-PMUT-Signals-Using-FFT-in-MATLAB) | Analysis of Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (PMUT) time domain signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in MATLAB to identify dominant frequencies and characterize resonant behavior for improved transducer performance. |
| [Fusion 360 Design Portfolio](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/fusion360-sample-modeling/tree/main) | Collection of my 3D design projects created using Autodesk Fusion 360. These models include General model, RF fixture components, custom enclosures, and mechanical parts developed while learning and exploring 3D CAD design for RF/mmWave applications. |
