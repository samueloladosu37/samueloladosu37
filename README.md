## 📂 Portfolio Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Smart Arduino Home Security System with Password-Enabled Alarm and Multi-Sensor Control](https://github.com/samueloladosu37/Arduino-project-on-Home-Security) | An Arduino-based home security system that integrates multiple sensors (DHT11, PIR, flame, reed switch, photoresistor) with a password-enabled alarm. Features real-time LCD display, sensor-triggered alerts, and custom password logic for secure arming/disarming. |
| [Patch-Antenna-Design-28GHz](mmWave-5G-Channel-MATLAB-Simulation) | HFSS model of a 28 GHz mmWave patch antenna with gain optimization. Radiation pattern and return loss results included. |
| [RF-Test-Automation-Python](./RF-Projects/RF-Test-Automation-Python) | Python script to automate VNA measurements and S-parameter plotting. |
